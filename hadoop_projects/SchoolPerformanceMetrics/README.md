# School Performance Metrics - Hadoop MapReduce Project

## Overview
This project analyzes school performance data using Hadoop MapReduce to calculate:
- Total scores and attendance
- Student count
- Grade distribution (A, B, C, D, F)

## Files
- `SchoolPerformanceMetrics.java` - Main MapReduce implementation
- `run_hadoop.sh` - Complete setup and execution script
- `data.csv` - Sample student data (generated by script)

## Quick Start
```bash
cd hadoop_projects/SchoolPerformanceMetrics
./run_hadoop.sh
```

## Manual Execution
1. Set environment variables:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk
export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

2. Start Hadoop services:
```bash
start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh
```

3. Compile and run:
```bash
javac -classpath `hadoop classpath` -d . SchoolPerformanceMetrics.java
jar -cvf SchoolPerformanceMetrics.jar *.class
hadoop jar SchoolPerformanceMetrics.jar SchoolPerformanceMetrics /user/$(whoami)/SchoolPerformanceMetrics/input /user/$(whoami)/SchoolPerformanceMetrics/output
```

## Expected Output
- Grade_A: Count of A grades
- Grade_B: Count of B grades  
- Grade_C: Count of C grades
- Grade_D: Count of D grades
- Grade_F: Count of F grades
- StudentCount: Total students
- TotalAttendance: Sum of all attendance
- TotalScore: Sum of all scores
